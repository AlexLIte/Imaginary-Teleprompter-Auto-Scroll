CHANGELOG

v2.0a 15.12.29 build 011
+ Recreated animation engine from scratch. Now using CSS Transform animations for hardware accelerated graphics.
+ Separated javascript and css from teleprompter.html.
+ Added mouse wheel acceleration control.
+ Added 'Custom' Prompter Style mode. Currently unfinished at index.html, sends hardcoded values to teleprompter.html.
+ Normalized animation speed across resolutions.
+ Added synchronization mechanisms for multiple teleprompter instances. These mechanisms are based on localStorage events. Currently working on Mozilla and partially on Webkit browsers.
+ Normalized animation speed across resolutions.
+ Prompter auto corrects vertical displacement errors caused by resize and orientation changes.
+ Prompt always stays in range of smallest screen.
