+ Implemented all of CKEditor's features using TinyMCE.
+ Improved TinyMCE Integration. Some bugs remain though.

+ Added mouse wheel acceleration control.
+ Added 'Custom' Prompter Style mode. Currently unfinished at index.html, sends hardcoded values to teleprompter.html.
+ Normalized animation speed across resolutions.

+ Normalized animation speed across resolutions.
+ Prompter auto corrects vertical displacement errors caused by resize and orientation changes.
+ Prompt always stays in range of smallest screen.
